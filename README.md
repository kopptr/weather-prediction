weather-prediction
==================

This is a demo application that trains machine learning models to predict the
weather, makes predictions on live data, and evaluates its performance.

The weather-prediction application was created to demonstrate the efficacy of
[Concourse](https://concourse.ci/) as an automation tool to drive data science
workflows and applications.
